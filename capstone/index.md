**Capstone, Part 1: Capstone Topic + Dataset Validation: Week 4**

In Part 1 of the Capstone, the brief was to choose a topic and problem, describing your goals & criteria for success, potential audience(s), and identifying 1-2 potential datasets. 

The format to present this information is in a slide deck and Pecha Kucha format, 3 slides in 3 minutes! Whilst this was a lightning fast introduction to our project, it provided a valuable opportunity to train our thoughts into what the success criteria of our projects will be and how the analysis may be structured.

To introduce you to my project, please follow the link to the slide deck of my 3 minute project pitch.

_Project Summary_

The main objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict the severity of a natural catastrophe from social data within a certain level of confidence. Following an exploratory data analysis, I will use natural language processing to analyse social posts and investigate which machine learning algorithms generate the most robust models to prove my hypothesis - that the language, volume and interconnectivity of social posts can indicate the a catastrophe's magnitude. 

The factors that determine the severity of these events, particularly from an insurance perspective, include  financial/insurance loss, the number of claims or damage reports and the geographic extent. These will be the key indicators of catastrophic loss I will hope to get from the model.

As it is not possible to analyse all catastrophe types within the period of the Capstone, I will focus on analysing **Twitter data** for major Australian **hail storm** events. I have selected two events for my analysis:

- Brisbane Hail Storm (27th November 2014): AUD 1,400m insurance loss
- Sydney Hail Storm (25th April 2015): AUD 400m insurance loss

I have chosen these events because they are two of the most significant hail storms from an insurance perspective during the age of Twitter, but their catastrophic loss attributes (loss, claims and geography) are significantly different.

Now that the project is pitched, I will begin exploring my data further and report back with my findings.  

_Next: Exploratory Data Analysis. More to follow soon..._
