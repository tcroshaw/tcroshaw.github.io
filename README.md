### Code, Posts and Projects

Welcome to the landing page for my personal github account.

I have worked in analytics for many years but now I am beginning my exploration deeper into data, starting with the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly in Sydney (Mar - Jun 2017).

Keep up to date with my progress with coding, projects and posts here!
