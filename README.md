## Projects, Posts and Codeshare

Welcome to the landing page for my personal github account!

My career has taken me from studying rocks as a geologist in the mines of Western Australia to analysing catastrophes in the insurance industry as a research analyst. The success of these roles and the services they provide rely on a common element: **Data**. I now find myself at General Assembly studying the Data Science Immersive course in Sydney (Mar - Jun 2017), to learn the tools and techniques to create powerful insights and predictions with data.

This page will keep you up to date with progress on my data science journey and I will share coding, projects and posts here as I go!

## Can Social Data Predict a Natural Catastrophe?
_April - June 2017_

This project is an investigation into how Twitter data can be used to predict major natural catastrophes. Specifically, can social data help us determine whether:
- There will be a large financial loss
- A significant number of insurance claims will be received
- A large area will be impacted by the event

This investigation was my Data Science Immersive Capstone Project at General Assembly, Sydney. Please follow the link below to view the progress of the analysis:
