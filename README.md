This project is an investigation into how Twitter data can be used to predict major natural catastrophes. Specifically, can social data help us determine whether:
- There will be a large financial loss
- A significant number of insurance claims will be received
- A large area will be impacted by the event

This investigation was my Data Science Immersive Capstone Project at General Assembly, Sydney. Please follow the link below to view the progress of the analysis:

This project is an investigation into whether property attribute data can be used to predict the sale price of a home. It approaches the analysis from the perspective of an property investment company looking to optimise returns. 

The analysis uses the Ames, Iowa Housing dataset and compares the impact of fixed, permanent property features on the sales price to those that can be changed i.e.: renovation potential.
