### Codeshare, Posts and Projects

Welcome to the landing page for my personal github account!

My career so far has taken me from studying rocks as a geologist in the mines of WA to analysisng catastrophes in re/insurance as a research analyst. The success of these roles (and the services they provided) relied on a common theme: **Data**. My desire to advance my understanding of data and analysis skills has bought me to General Assembly to study the Data Science Immersive course in Sydney (Mar - Jun 2017).

This page will keep you up to date with my progress on my data science path and I will share coding, projects and posts here!

### Can Social Data Predict the Severity Natural Catastrophes?


This project is an investigation into how Twitter data can be used to predict the severity of major natural catastrophes. Specifically, can social data help us determine:
- Which areas have sustained the greatest damage?
- How large will the financial loss be?
- How many claims can be expected?

Please follow the link below to view the progress of the investigation:
