This project is an investigation into how Twitter data can be used to predict major natural catastrophes. Specifically, can social data help us determine whether:
- There will be a large financial loss
- A significant number of insurance claims will be received
- A large area will be impacted by the event

This investigation was my Data Science Immersive Capstone Project at General Assembly, Sydney. Please follow the link below to view the progress of the analysis:
